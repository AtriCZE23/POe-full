* Updated data files (uniques etc).

2.15.6
================================================================================================

* Added support for multiple influences on items.
* Added basic search options for quality (catalysed) on rings and amulets.
* Maps now have always their map tier included in searches.
* Searches using the item type now use "Staff"/"Dagger" instead of "Warstaff"/"Rune Dagger" as a bad workaround for poe.trade not knowing these types exist.
* Changed the item affix lookup macro to now use poedb.tw instead of poeaffix.net.
* Updated cURL.
* Fixed rare items with abyssal sockets not being parsed correctly for the advanced search.
* Fixed wrong number of normal sockets being included in the advanced search when an item has an abyssal socket.
* Fixed macro update version check exception/error message activate focused, which could unfocus the game. Which is bad.
* Updated data files (uniques etc.).

2.15.3
================================================================================================
* Changed the default (main) hotkeys from using "ctrl" to using "alt" to prevent conflicts with PoEs new second skillbar hotkeys. This will not change any settings of existing TradeMacro installations.

* Added poe.ninja price history data to normal price requests for certain item types (maps, currency, fossils).
* Updated data files.
* Fixed poe.ninja API urls, which where changed, breaking some requests.

* Fixed the beyond map mod not being recognized by ItemInfos map mod warnings.
* Added the currently selected search league to the tray icon tooltip.
* Added an update check that repeats every 2 hours, shows a tray tip ballon notification and a different tray icon when an update is available. This notification won't be visible when using any application in fullscreen.

2.14.2
================================================================================================
* Fixed event leagues not being parsed and therefore not being available in the league selection.

2.14.1
================================================================================================
* Hotfixed the parsing of crafted mords (advanced search) which was broken in PoE 3.6.
* Updated data files (uniques, supported mods).

2.14.0
================================================================================================
* Initial support for the Synthesis league (synthesised and fractured items):
	** Added parsing for these item bases and mods.
	** Added advanced search support for these items.
	** BE CAREFUL when pricing synthesised/fractured items in the first days. Don't fully trust the macro, prefer to open the search in your browser and check the search form.
	** Restart the macro every day to pull the latest data file updates (which includes the list of poe.trade supported mods).
* Adjusted the handling of enchantments since they aren't implicit mods anymore.
* Updated all data files. As alwyays further updates will have to wait until the wiki is updated (new and updated uniques/enchantments).
* Fixed poe.ninja item urls.

2.13.1
================================================================================================
* Added a new splash screen.
* Further improved handling of various (runtime) errors.
* Various small improvements/fixes.

2.12.5
================================================================================================
* Improved feedback for issues with poe.trade http requests.
* Added a "Curl/HTTP request timeout" option. Increasing this timeout can help with issues related to requests taking too long (server issues).
* Fixed a script run error for the standalone ItemInfo script.

2.12.4
================================================================================================
* Fixed an issue that broke most requests to poe.trade (except currency).
* Increased the timeout parameter for requests to poeprices.info.
* Further improved feedback for failed request to poeprices.info.
* Fixed an issue where corrupted jewels where searched as "not corrupted" when using advanced search.
* Other small fixes and improvements.

2.12.3
================================================================================================
* Added more and more detailed error feedback for poeprices requests (price prediction).
* Improved overall error handling and feedback for different script/run errors.
* Fixed fossil price search not working with the alternative currency search (poe.ninja).
* Removed "fallback.exe" (the compiled script) from the default release. It can still be downloaded and used if you really want it.
* Updated all data files (uniques, gem quality etc).

2.12.2
================================================================================================
* Updated data files (uniques)
* Advanced search
	** You can now include an items veiled prefix/suffix.
	** Unfortunately poe.trade only allows to filter whether an item is veiled, not whether it has a veiled prefix/suffix.

2.12.1
================================================================================================
* QoL features for the color blind:
	** `Ctrl + c` now also has the items socket string added to the tooltip, example "R-G-B B-B-G".
	** `Ctrl + c` on a Gem now has added its color to the tooltip.
	** A new hotkey (`Alt + c`) shows a tooltip with a graphical/text representation of the items sockets (color, links, position).
	** This new hotkey also shows a gems color.
* Lutbot logout macro integration:
	** LutTools (Lutbot) is a collection of logout, whisper reply and basic price check features.
	** TradeMacro supports the newly released Lite-Version which only has the TCP logout features included.
	** TradeMacro only helps in managing this script by giving you the option to run it on script start and check for hotkey conflicts.
	** The Lutbot macro itself stays as a seperate installation with seperated development and maintaining.
	** This integration is accessible from a new tab "Lutbot" in the settings menu.
* Hideout decoration stash search:
	** The already existing search/highlighting feature (`Ctrl + f`) for your stash search can now also help filtering your hideout stash.
	** Pressing the hotkey on a decoration item in the decoration purchase window inputs its name into the hideout stash filter field.
	** The games `Ctrl + f` hotkey would focus the purchase windows filter field instead, pressing it when not hovering over a decoration still does this.
	** The hotkey added to the "AdditionalMacros" tab needs the coordinates of your hideout stash filter field to click on it, you may have to edit those settings.
	** This feature can be disabled independently from the stash highlighting feature.
	** This allows quickly looking up how many of a specific decoration from the vendor you already own.
	** Let's hope this doesn't break with the Betrayal update.
* Advanced Search:
	** Focusing one of a mods/stats value edit fields now automatically marks the checkbox to include it in the search. This behaviour can be disabled in the settings.
	** Corrupted Jewels now have a checkbox to not include the corrupted state in the search, which was previously forced.
	** Improved matching of item affixes and mods supported by poe.trade (fixed some issues).
	** Fixed the issue that the variable/random mods on the Watcher's Eye were missing from the UI.
* Hotkey Assignment:
	** Previously TradeMacro didn't detect any hotkey conflicts.
	** You will now be warned of any conflicts and asked to resolve the issues.
* Fixed an issue with poedb urls for some unique items.
* Fixed an issue with the league name in the poe-antiquary url.
* Improved encoding the item data for poeprices requests which caused exceptions or failed for some users.
* Small UI improvements.
* The splashscreen ("Initializing script..." and memes) now stays longer on screen, previously it was disabled too early. If this is too annoying I don't mind reverting this. You can also find how to start without any splashscreen on the github wiki under "Usage Installation".

2.11.2
================================================================================================
* Advanced search: Added an option to include any search parameter (mod/stat line) to the search simply by focusing any of its edit fields. Enabled by default.

2.11.1
================================================================================================
* Removed the hotkey to open an item on pathof.info since it's outdated and kind of obsolete with PoE's advanced mod descriptions.
* Added a new feature to show your items loot filter highlighting, mostly targeted at newer players.
	** Default hotkey is `Ctrl + Alt + C`, which previously was used for the pathof.info feature.
	** Requires a successfully loaded custom loot filter.
	** This feature is part of `Additional Macros` and can be changed/disabled in the respective settings tab.
	** Probably not bug-free at this point.
* Changed the default search to force the number of Abyssal Sockets if the item has any. So far this was only possible by using the advanced search.
* Updated all data files, as usual (uniques etc).
* Changed requests to poe.ninja to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

2.10.9
================================================================================================
* Fixed an issue where the advanced search could ignore/omit the name of unique jewels.
* Improved support for different keyboard layouts.

2.10.8
================================================================================================
* Added additional information to the predicted pricing results to show in what way the mods/properties contribute to the predicted price.
* Small fixes and changes to prepare for the Delve league.

2.10.7
================================================================================================
* Fixed a recently introduced issue with the url used by the currency search (new minimum stock size parameter required).
* Excluded unidentified rare items from predicted pricing.

2.10.6
================================================================================================
* Hotfixed an issue introduced in 2.10.5 where some searches could be missing any type and base parameters, making the search broader than intended.
* Fixed an issue with using the predicted pricing on items directly from chat. The item data contains some extra characters related to localisations, which are currently not handled by poeprices. 

2.10.5
================================================================================================
* Fixed an issue where searches using the item base of a few sceptres (at least Tyrant's Sekhem) didn't work because their item type was still classified as "Mace" instead of "Sceptre".
* Reduced the request timeout for searches using poeprices.info.
* Improved the poeprices error tooltip in the hope that issue reports go to them more often. I can't do anything about most issues except forwarding them since they are related to their servers/API.
* Updated all data files (uniques, supported mods on poe.trade etc). 

2.10.4
================================================================================================
* Fixed an issue where multiple corrupted implicits on items were not supported by the advanced search.
* Fixed an issue where a Tabula Rasa with a corrupted implicit was not supported by the advanced search.
* Fixed an issue where requests to poe.trade timed out for some people. A fallback request could still be made but the entire process took up to a minute. Please report if this change causes your searches to fail completely (should not happen).

2.10.3
================================================================================================
* Fixed some issues with gem searches. Some Vaal Gem names weren't parsed correctly and some new Gems are not available as a "base" option on poe.trade, causing searches in these cases to fail.
* Updated data files (uniques, mods etc), which was done "silently" before without a need to release an update. Just remember to restart your macro here and there at league start to download these updated files.

2.10.2
================================================================================================
* Changed the default hotkey for the currency ratio function to "alt + r" since the current "ctrl + r" overwrites the hideout decoration rotate hotkey. This won't change the hotkey for already installed scripts.
* The currency ratio GUI can now also be closed by pressing escape.

* ItemInfo:
** Updated Uniques, Divination Cards, Maps and Gem Quality info
** Bugfix: Quantity on shaper amulets is no longer mistaken for a legacy quantity roll.

2.10.1
================================================================================================
* Hotfixed an issue introduced with the last update where numbers where incorrectly formatted as hexadecimal instead of integer, breaking the item parsing.
* Added a trimmed mean value in addition to the average and median values to the pricing result tooltip.
* Fixed wiki urls for item bases.  

2.10.0
================================================================================================
* Fixed an issue with event leagues, where these leagues not being available anymore would fail to cause the macro to automatically fall back to the permanent/challenge leagues without user interaction.
* Made some preparations to parse the new Vaal Gems in 3.3.0.
* Reverted the change of removing the pathof.info hotkey (ctrl + alt + c), some of you wanted it back. The poe-antiquary hotkey introduced in the last update was changed to ctrl + alt + a because it took the removed hotkeys place.
* Added an option to open supported items on poe.ninja instead of poe.trade (ctrl + q).
* Implemented a secondary "have" currency, used when "want" equals primary "have". This refers to the "Currency Search" and "Secondary Currency" dropdowns in the settings menu, used for currency searches. For example, if chaos is selected as the "have" currency, when searching for chaos price ("want"), a useless chaos:chaos listing is produced. With this patch, a secondary "have" currency can be defined, which is used when "want" currency equals the primary "have" currency.
* Added an option to use "exact currency search" on poe.trade, this only works when using the default or advanced search and uses the "Currency Search" and "Secondary Currency" dropdowns in the settings menu to select the primaray and fallback currency for this search. If the primary search returns no results, the search gets repeated with the fallback currency.
* Added ItemInfo details for prophecies. Unfortunately this still only works for sealed prophecies, not the ones on the prophecy screen/menu. These details include the seal cost, objective and reward, basically what you can find on the wiki.
* Added Dvorak keyboard layout support.
* Improved support for windows high-contrast/custom themes (Gui window colors).

2.9.0
================================================================================================
* Changed behaviour of advanced searchs ilvl handling for shaper/elder items, the ilvl is now always filled and selected.
* Replaced the hotkey to open an advanced affix lookup on http://pathof.info (ctrl + alt +c) with a hotkey to open items on http://poe-antiquary.xyz, if available.
* Added a new hotkey (ctrl + r when hovering over currency) to open a dialog to create notes for premium stash tabs. This dialog let's you set sell/receive amount and currency type or a ratio and uses the currency short-hands/IDs used by all trade sites to parse currency trade ratios/prices. Just give it a try to see what it does.
* Properly supported Abyssal Sockets on items, especially unique items (advanced search). Items like Bubonic Trail will now have a checkbox to include the number of sockets, already selected. This didn't work before because the item mod wasn't supported on poe.trade as a mod but as a seperate option instead.

* Fixed searching Elder maps not working. 
* Fixed the broken parsing for average/median values (price results).
* Various other small fixes.

2.8.0
================================================================================================
* Added support for Beast Trading. This initial implementation may be lacking but it's late in the night and it's still not quite sure how all aspects of this should be handled. Feel free to give suggestions for improvements.
* Fixed an issue with pseudomods where totem and minion resitances where added as player resistances (jewels).
* Fixed an issue where Shaped Vault maps weren't found since their base doesn't exist on poe.trade.

* ItemInfo:
** "Adds # to # damage" mods now have an additional line that displays the average values of the damage ranges.
** The "total" column of added damage mods has been changed. Suppose there is a mod with three brackets: 1-3 to 7-9, 11-13 to 17-19, 21-23 to 27-29. It used to display as "1-3|27-29", the worst lower range and the best upper range. It now displays "1-23|7-29", the range over all lower values and the range over all upper values.

2.7.7
================================================================================================
* Fixed sceptres using their base type "one handed maces" on poe.trade instead of "sceptres" as type.
* Fixed an issue where some shaper/elder mods where falsely identified as "implicit mods" on poe.trade.
* Changed the default hotkey for the function to open items on peoapp to "ctrl + shift + q" to since using "ctrl + alt + q" prevented typing the @ character on some keyboard layouts. You have to manually change your hotkey in the settings though if you have that issue currently.
* Fixed some searches falsely including unique items in their results when the searched item is non-unique.
* Fixed a rare issue that caused the cURL requests to fail for some people. 

2.7.6
================================================================================================
* Added simple support for opening an item on poeapp.com, the default hotkey is ctrl + alt + q and can be changed in the settings menu.
* Updated all data files (uniques etc.), since that data comes from the wiki and the wiki was broken a while ago there where some issues updating these files.
* Fixed a few issues with unique flasks and certain mods on other uniqe items not working with the advanced search.
* Added full support for unique items having variations. You can now use the advanced search on items like Vessel of Vinktar and search for the specific version that you have.
* Fixed the buyout only option not working anymore because of changes on poe.trades side.
* Improved the script updater and it's error handling; fixed a few uncommon issues.
* Small improvements to the requests to poeprices.info.

* ItemInfo:
** Updated and rewritten information for maps.
** Updated Uniques and Divination Cards with wiki information.
** NO (!) support for Elder/Shaper mods. Waiting on GGG's advanced tier info for the clipboard, for now.
** Slight parsing and display changes.
** Parsing fix for shaped maps.
** Fixed most cases where long mods with linebreaks would cause issues.
** Added Gem Quality information for the three new v3.2 gems.	
	
2.7.5
================================================================================================
* Fixed a rare cURL request issue.
* The windows for the advanced search and custom search can now be submitted (starting the search) by pressing "Enter".
* Fixed a small (graphical) UI issues.

2.7.4
================================================================================================
* Fixed the predicted pricing request for the hardcore abyss league.
* Added some options to use and set Gem XP in searches.

2.7.3
================================================================================================
* Fixed an issue that caused the predicted pricing being used for the advanced search and item age check.

* ItemInfo:
** Included updates from the TradeMacro. Most importantly the "AdditionalMacros" now have a tab in the settings menu.
** Updates for certain 3.1 content:
***  All new general item mods should be included (mostly new T1 mods)
***  Full support for Abyss Jewels
***  Updated Gem Quality
***  Included some of the new uniques. More will follow once the wiki situation is sorted out or at least better.

2.7.2
================================================================================================
* Fixed an issue with the poeprices.info logger.
* Fixed the poeprices paypal link.

2.7.1
================================================================================================
* Added a log file "<TradeMacroFolder>\temp\poeprices_log.txt" for failed requests to poeprices.info.
** Instructions were to report those issues are inside.
*Fixed an issue with the send feedback request to poeprices.info.

2.7.0
================================================================================================
* Implemented a predicted item pricing/search using machine learning algorithms:
** This feature uses the ML pricing from poeprices.info.
** For the moment it will only work with rare items, magic items will likely be enabled in the near future.
** This feature replaces the default search (ctrl + d) but is optional and can be disabled again in the settings.
** Be aware that this feature could return correct prices, but also be completely off the mark, improving it needs the help of the community.
* Added poedb.tw as an alternative to the PoE Wiki (open item on wiki hoteky). This is a toggle option and has to be enabled in the settings ("general" section).
* Fixed the new maps not working with the stash highlight hotkey.
 
2.6.3
================================================================================================
* Fixed an issue that caused the new maps not being searched correctly.

2.6.2
================================================================================================
* Added the new mods available on poe.trade.
* Fixed some issues with those new mods (abyss jewels/elder/shaper items).
* Updated data files (enchantments/corruptions/uniques.

2.6.1
================================================================================================
* Added parsing for the new bases (elder/shaper items and abyss jewels/Stygian Vise belt).
* The search options/parameters for these bases should work, may need some fixing though when the new patch is live. Be careful at the start when pricing these bases.

2.6.0
================================================================================================
Big new features/changes:
1) Full rework of ItemInfo affix parsing.
2) Alternative tooltip display option using the GDI+ library/dll.
3) Reworked INI handling.
4) Settings menu rework.

While there shouldn't be any issues updating from any beta or stable version, try deleting your user files (.ini files) if there are issues starting the macro after updating.

1) ItemInfo affix parsing:
* The script handles potentially ambiguous mods completely different now. Multiple possibilities are shown when the script considers all of them fitting. This means in particular that hybrid mods are now almost fully supported. Please report items where the scripts results seem wrong. (A few cases currently remain unhandled, these will be fixed later. See the end of section 1 for details.)
* Flasks mods are supported now.
* The user settings were reworked. Most "Display" settings were removed and replaced by new ones. Tell if you miss anything.
* Ingame tooltip changes:
** Implicit value ranges are shown now.
** The detailed affix overview has a header now (which can be disabled in the settings).
** Long notation of double ranges ("added damage" mods) is the default now. (settings option)
** A new notation for "multi tier ranges" has been introduced. These are shown when multiple mods overlap in a way that makes it uncertain which tier combination was actually rolled. They show the worst case range and best case range for the roll. Contrary to "double range" mods this does not mean that you can certainly get to the top roll (via Divine Orbs), it means your actual roll range is somewhere within the displayed ranges.
** All these notations aswell as new abbreviations get a 1 line info at the end of the tooltip when they are present.
** The top section with basic information and DPS calculation for weapons was rearranged. It includes a warning now when a low itemlevel lowers the item's max socket number. Furthermore Q20PhysDps got added.
* Currently unhandled affix cases:
** Weapons with #% increased Physical Damage, +# to Accuracy Rating and 5-10% increased Light Radius. (up to 4 mods mix)
** Tower shields with #% increased Armour, #% increased Stun and Block Recovery and +#% Chance to Block. (up to 5 mods mix)

2) GDI+ display:
* You can enable GDI+ in the settings menu, which results in a tooltip using the GDI+ graphics library. This alternative tooltip allows colour customization and transparency.
** It won't be initialised on script start if it's not enabled, this is a fix for a potential issue where having GDI+ enabled/initialized can cause FPS drops. 

3) Reworked .ini handling:
* The first macro start after updating from the last stable version may overwrite some INI files, or small parts of them, while converting the old files.
* User defined settings will now persist between new version updates (proper INI file updating instead of overwriting).
* The script should now run correctly regardless of the selected keyboard layout, previously non-latin layouts like russian caused errors related to hotkeys on script start.
* AdditionalMacros hotkeys, their states and other configurations should be changed in AdditionalMacros.ini from now on.
* AdditionalMacros.txt was moved out of the user folder and shouldn't be edited anymore. The subfolder CustomMacros with it's user created/added/edited scripts serves its old purpose from now on.
* MapModWarning states should be changed in MapModWarnings.ini.

4) Settings menu rework:
* The window is now wider and shorter in height to better accommodate different screensizes.
* Improved readability with a different font.
* Added an option to copy generated URLs to the clipboard instead of opening them.
* Added a tab for AdditionalMacros settings:
** Up until now you still had to edit the .ini files to change these settings.
** The hotkey selection UI element is a bit experimental and might cause issues for people using non-latin keybaord layouts. Using the default input box was not sufficient because it doesn't support special keys and mouse buttons.
** Editing via .ini file is still possible, of course.

5) Minor notes and bugfixes:
* Fixed the alternative currency search (via poe.ninja) being broken (API changes).
* Fixed ItemInfo/TradeMacro currency rate fetching/parsing (and ItemInfos currency stack conversion to chaos equivalent).
* Fixed a potential issue with hotkey assigning when the ini files have invalid values assigned (space for example).
* Fixed the corrupted option (search) override not working (missing INI key).
* Fixed an issue that caused temporary (race) leagues not being saved.
* Fixed some special mods not working on poe.trade (advanced search).
* Fixed clipboard being emptied at script start.
* Fixed the "Remove multiple Listings from same Account" option not working anymore.
* Fixed some issues with the "Fallback.exe" file.

* ItemInfo only:
** Fixed Chance To Poison / Increased Poison Damage that was swapped.
** Chance To Bleed's data file was missing a | character so a value was not read properly.
** 3.0's new increased Cast Speed mod for ES shields was missing.
** 3.0's new increased Attack Damage mod for AR/EV hybrid base shields is now correctly considered as a prefix and not a suffix.
** Adapted rewording of jewel Bleeding suffix and jewel Poison Duration suffix.
** Fixed MapModWarning for "Monsters cannot be Stunned".
** Map Info: Lair Map upgrades to Mineral Pools (not Spider Forest).
** The gem quality info for Summon Skeleton gets displayed now (by not expecting "Summon Skeletons").
** Fixed a bug with increased Elemental Damage with Attack Skills: There are two almost identical progressions, but the script only knew one. This is not a new change, but simply was never noticed. It is now correctly differentiated between 'on weapon' and 'on other item type' which shifts the T2 to T1 breakpoint from 37/38 to 36/37.
** +Flat Def on non-armour pieces (like belts) are now handled correctly.
** Fixed a bug about mismatching data of similarly named uniques.
** Lines in the affix overview are no longer duplicated if they are identical (and only the other line of the hybrid mod part varies).
** Uncertain mods in the affix overview no longer cause multiple lines with identical entries. This happened when a hybrid mod brought multiple variants to one part/line, but the other part/line was unambiguous.
** Flat +Def on non-armour pieces (like belts) is now handled correctly.
** Fixed a bug about mismatching data of similarly named uniques.
** Fixed the MapModCount for tier 1-5 maps with the hybrid mod "Monster Life / Stun Immune".

Fixed a potential issue with hotkey assigning when the ini files have invalid values assigned (space for example).

2.6.0-beta.1
================================================================================================
Three big new features:
1) Full rework of ItemInfo affix parsing.
2) Alternative tooltip display option using the GDI+ library/dll.
3) Reworked INI handling.

These changes are quite extensive and will likely bring a few bugs that were not found. This is a beta-release for that reason. Please report issues, preferably on GitHub.

1) ItemInfo affix parsing:
* The script handles potentially ambiguous mods completely different now. Multiple possibilities are shown when the script considers all of them fitting. This means in particular that hybrid mods are now almost fully supported. Please report items where the scripts results seem wrong. (A few cases currently remain unhandled, these will be fixed later. See the end of section 1 for details.)
* Flasks mods are supported now.
* The user settings were reworked. Most "Display" settings were removed and replaced by new ones. Tell if you miss anything.
* Ingame tooltip changes:
** Implicit value ranges are shown now.
** The detailed affix overview has a header now (which can be disabled in the settings).
** Long notation of double ranges ("added damage" mods) is the default now. (settings option)
** A new notation for "multi tier ranges" has been introduced. These are shown when multiple mods overlap in a way that makes it uncertain which tier combination was actually rolled. They show the worst case range and best case range for the roll. Contrary to "double range" mods this does not mean that you can certainly get to the top roll (via Divine Orbs), it means your actual roll range is somewhere within the displayed ranges.
** All these notations aswell as new abbreviations get a 1 line info at the end of the tooltip when they are present.
** The top section with basic information and DPS calculation for weapons was rearranged. It includes a warning now when a low itemlevel lowers the item's max socket number. Furthermore Q20PhysDps got added.
* Currently unhandled affix cases:
** Weapons with #% increased Physical Damage, +# to Accuracy Rating and 5-10% increased Light Radius. (up to 4 mods mix)
** Tower shields with #% increased Armour, #% increased Stun and Block Recovery and +#% Chance to Block. (up to 5 mods mix)

2) GDI+ display:
* You can enable GDI+ in the settings menu, which results in a tooltip using the GDI+ graphics library. This alternative tooltip allows colour customization and transparency.

3) Reworked .ini handling:
* User defined settings will now persist between new version updates (proper INI file updating instead of overwriting).
* The script should now run correctly regardless of the selected keyboard layout, previously non-latin layouts like russian caused errors related to hotkeys on script start.
* AdditionalMacros hotkeys, their states and other configurations should be changed in AdditionalMacros.ini from now on.
* AdditionalMacros.txt was moved out of the user folder and shouldn't be edited anymore. The subfolder CustomMacros with it's user created/added/edited scripts serves its old purpose from now on.
* MapModWarning states should be changed in MapModWarnings.ini.

4) Minor notes and bugfixes:
* Fixed Chance To Poison / Increased Poison Damage that was swapped.
* Chance To Bleed's data file was missing a | character so a value was not read properly.
* 3.0's new increased Cast Speed mod for ES shields was missing.
* 3.0's new increased Attack Damage mod for AR/EV hybrid base shields is now correctly considered as a prefix and not a suffix.
* Adapted rewording of jewel Bleeding suffix and jewel Poison Duration suffix.
* Fixed MapModWarning for "Monsters cannot be Stunned".
* Map Info: Lair Map upgrades to Mineral Pools (not Spider Forest).
* The gem quality info for Summon Skeleton gets displayed now (by not expecting "Summon Skeletons").
* Fixed a bug with increased Elemental Damage with Attack Skills: There are two almost identical progressions, but the script only knew one. This is not a new change, but simply was never noticed. It is now correctly differentiated between 'on weapon' and 'on other item type' which shifts the T2 to T1 breakpoint from 37/38 to 36/37.
