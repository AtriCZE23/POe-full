`Name,[Level],[Quality],[Rarity1,[Rarity2,[Rarity3]]]`
 - now it's best to use the Item Filter Parser
 
Examples of valid declarations:
```
Vaal Regalia,78
Corsair Sword,78,10
Gold Ring,75,,Normal,Rare
Ironscale Gauntlets,,10,Normal,Magic
Quicksilver Flask,1,5
Portal Scroll
Iron Ring
```
Also the mods used for mobs and items are listed in Content.ggpk\Data\Mods.dat.

### Before build
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Requirements

* Require Microsoft C++ Redistributable
* .NET framerwork v.4.6 or newer (you already have it on Windows 8+)
* Windows Vista or newer (XP won't work)
* Path of Exile should be running in Windowed or Windowed Fullscreen mode (the pure Fullscreen mode does not let PoeHUD draw anything over the game window)
* Windows Aero transparency effects must be enabled. (If you get a black screen this is the issue)
* DirectX 9 redistributable.
